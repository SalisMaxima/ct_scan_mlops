# Dual-Pathway Model with Top Features Only
#
# This model combines a ResNet18 CNN backbone with only the top-performing
# hand-crafted radiomics features (16 features with importance >= 0.002).
#
# Architecture:
#   Image -> ResNet18 -> CNN Features (512-d)
#                              |
#   Radiomics (16) -> FC -> Radiomics Features (128-d)
#                              |
#                        Concatenate (640-d)
#                              |
#                        Fusion Layers
#                              |
#                        Classification (4 classes)
#
# Feature selection based on permutation importance analysis.
# Baseline: 50 features @ 81.27% accuracy
# Optimized: 16 features (removed 34 low/negative importance features)
